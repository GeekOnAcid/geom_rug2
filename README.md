# geom_rug2
A custom version of `geom_rug()` dash margin function (from R package [`ggthemes` by Jeffrey B. Arnold](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html)) that makes dashes equal independent of the plot size. The function was 'hacked' by user [Bonded Dust](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1855677/bondeddust) as a [reply to this *Stackoverflow* question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33223311/ggplot2-geom-rug-produces-different-line-length-with-wide-plot/33230234#33230234).
