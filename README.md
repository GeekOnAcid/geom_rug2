# geom_rug2
A custom version of `geom_rug()` dash margin function (from R package [`ggplot2` by Hadley Wickham](http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/geom_rug.html)). The original `geom_rug()` makes margin dashes of unequal length depending on plot size. The current `geom_rug2()` was modified by user [Bonded Dust](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1855677/bondeddust) as a [reply to this *Stackoverflow* question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33223311/ggplot2-geom-rug-produces-different-line-length-with-wide-plot/33230234#33230234) where the issue with original `geom_rug()` function is also described in more detail. The function is used a a part of [*Tufte in R* project](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/#range-frame-or-quartile-frame-and-dot-dash-scatterplot).
